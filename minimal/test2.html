              <p>Before we get into the talk proper, where we'll be looking at what current web technologies offer for typesetting in the browser, I'd like everyone to just give a think about information technology. Since we are often said to be living in the information age right now.</p>
              <p>Information technology deals with the storage and retrieval of information, the extraction of higher levels of meaning from a collection of information and the transmission of information over large distances.</p>
              <p>Writing is the first information technology humans ever developed. And writing was so flexible. All you needed was a surface and an implement to create marks on that surface. Vincent Steer, founder of the British Typographers' Guild, had said that the character of any alphabet is dictated by the materials used in its expression.</p>
              <p>Cuneiform writing was made by using a wedge-shaped tool that was pressed into wet clay, the Egyptians wrote on papyrus with a reed pen, making their lines were soft and flowy. Chinese writing centred around the brush, and this too informed how Han characters evolved over time.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Technological advancement can generally be thought of as humanity's solution for producing more output for less effort. The advancement of information technology sought to reproduce writing at scale, from employing larger numbers of humans to copy scripts to the development of printing and digital technology.</p>
              <p>But with every increase in productivity, significant trade-offs were made. The techniques that won out over the course of human civilisation shape how we live today. There are a huge number of factors that came into play but what is undeniable is that modern day digital technology suits a particular style of writing system over others.</p>
              <p>I have no idea what an alternate history would look like because my reality is here and now. It's as if you're asking a person who has been colour-blind their whole life to imagine what green is. Science fiction writers probably do a better job of this, but I do wonder how different our lives would be if digital technology was pioneered in a different region.</p>

              <figcaption style="font-style:normal">Encoding options available in FontForge</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>The first encoding standard was the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII), which was originally based on the English alphabet and developed from telegraph code.</p>
              <p>Computer architecture at the time was largely 8-bit, while ASCII encoded characters in 7 bits, for the original 128 characters. There was capacity for another 128 characters and when computers reached countries outside America, everyone did their own thing to cater for their own language and character requirements.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Writing systems utilising Han characters consist of tens of thousands of glyphs. These were never going to fit into 8 bits. Local encoding systems like the Chinese Guobiao and the Taiwanese Big5 were developed to handle Chinese characters.</p>
              <p>Japan even created multiple systems for Japanese depending on the hardware, but the systems were not compatible with one another. The Japanese even have a term for the garbled output caused by text decoded with an unintended character encoding, called Mojibake (文字化け).</p>
              <p>This issue is less pronounced today with the widespread adoption of Unicode, but it is not solved. For example, Burmese text sometimes still doesn't display correctly on Facebook.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Every computer's operating system has a text rendering engine, which is responsible for rasterising the font outlines for display on the screen. Browsers' layout engines will defer to the operating system's text rendering engine. If there are multiple text rendering engines, the browser can pick which to use. This is why text looks different on Mac and Windows, and sometimes even vary on different browsers on the same machine.</p>
              <p>Electronic displays these days are fairly high resolution, but a huge majority of the screens we encounter are raster displays. Which means everything we see on screens are made up of individual discrete pixels. We've just managed to pack a lot more pixels onto a screen than we used to.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Designing Chinese characters is significantly more challenging as compared to Latin-based alphabets or Arabic numerals for a number of reasons. Firstly, the sheer volume of glyphs required for just for daily use alone is around 7000, but there are more than 50000 in existence.</p>
              <p>Such a monumental task, if undertaken by a single experienced designer working full time would probably take at least 3 years to complete the 6763 characters defined in the Chinese national standard. Most foundries employ a team working closely together over 3 to 5 months. However, this also increases the risk of inconsistency in structure and style across such a large volume of characters.</p>
              <p>The structure of Chinese characters are also more complex, often having more than 10 strokes and intersection points. Quite a challenge from a rendering perspective as well.</p>

            <aside class="notes">When the web first started, browsers could only choose between fonts that were already installed on their users host machines.

This proposal was eventually made a reality when browser vendors picked it up and implemented it.</aside>

              <p>To specify what font your website is using, we use the font-family property in CSS. This has been around since the beginning.</p>
              <p>Most of the time, system fonts will support an extended character set covering a majority of languages. Which is why the concept of font stacks matter when using web fonts. The order of the declared fonts makes a difference, as the browser goes through them from left to right.</p>
              <p>Ideally, your font stack should be made up of fonts that share similar characteristics, so it is not <strong>that</strong> obvious a fallback has been invoked for a particular missing glyph. Go for similar visual style, x-heights and stroke weights.</p>

              <p>Sometimes you'll see the corresponding character code in a rectangle, or simple a blank rectangle. Personally, I see much less of these, compared to a decade ago, thanks to the widespread use of Unicode.</p>

              <p>Web fonts are implemented in CSS with the <code>@font-face</code> rule, where you can declare a list of different formats for your font of choice. Given the support status these days, it's fairly safe to use just WOFF and WOFF2.</p>
              <p>Though there are many descriptors for declaring a web font with <code>@font-face</code>, only the <code>font-family</code> and <code>src</code>, are mandatory.</p>
              <p>The <code>font-family</code> descriptor works purely like a label, so we can reference the font data via CSS. So maybe you're using Helvetica, you don't have to put “Helvetica” as the descriptor. The <code>src</code> descriptor tells the browser where to find the font data, it could be an external URL, or a local font.</p>

              <p>This tool comes in very handy especially for those of you who build multilingual websites or even sites with a handful of foreign words, and you are using a typeface that may not support all the required characters.</p>
              <p>For example, this round sans-serif is Raleway, designed by the League of Moveable Type. It's pretty nice, in my opinion, but unfortunately, does not support Cyrillic characters. Which is a bummer, if I wanted to use it for a talk I'm giving in Ukraine, for example.</p>
              <p>So what we can do, is try to find a font that does contain those characters, and somewhat resembles the design of chosen font, then utilise the <code>unicode-range</code> descriptor to create a “composite font”.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>It's called a composite font because it mixes glyphs from different fonts for different scripts. To deal with the fact that <em>Raleway</em> does not support Cyrillic letters, we can use the <code>unicode-range</code> descriptor to tell the browser to load <em>Comfortaa</em>, which is a font that does, when it encounters any Cyrillic characters.</p>
              <p>Remember that for font-face rules, the font-family is simply a label, so what we've done is create a composite font that uses the name <em>Raleway</em>, but in actuality, loads 2 different font files depending on what characters need to be displayed.</p>

              <p>Most CJK system fonts, short for Chinese, Japanese and Korean, have very good glyph coverage, coming in between 20,000 to 30,000 glyphs. When web fonts were introduced, it allowed developers to send fonts that were not installed on their users' systems via a URL. Font data does take up bandwidth though, and font sizes are dependent on the size of the character set supported by the font.</p>
              <p>The nature of CJK fonts make them impractical from a performance standpoint as web fonts delivered over the internet. Currently, websites in those languages almost always use system fonts because a typical CJK font can go up to around 16mb.</p>

              <p>Variable fonts are a relatively recent development which allow a single font file to contain all the styles and weights the designer intended via variation axes. Developers can then access these options with CSS.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>If the medium we are operating in is the web, then our tool for the trade of typesetting is CSS. We are trying to do what folks have been doing since setting type became a thing, some underlying principles hold steadfast but our tools have changed over time.</p>
              <p>Declaring a content language on an element is one of the most basic things we can do, because it identifies the specific written form of the language to be used in that element, AKA the content writing system.</p>
              <p>This is important because language and writing system conventions affect lots of typographic effects like line breaking, hyphenation, justification, glyph selection and more.</p>
              <p>For CSS, language-specific typographic tailorings are only applied when the content language is explicitly declared. So it is in our best interest to tell the browser exactly what language our content is in to ensure a higher quality typographic experience for our users.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>To that point, font metrics are measurements of characters in a font and computers use these to determine how to layout characters on a line, things like spacing between lines, positions of sub and superscripts etc. But font metrics aren't mandatory and sometimes type designers don't include them, and that makes it hard for CSS to figure out what to do.</p>
              <p>This applies for all OpenType features. But when fonts do have these features, we can do interesting things via CSS.</p>

You could put a string in there as well.</p>
              <p>CSS has this <code>:lang</code> pseudo-class that will recognises the language of the content of an element. So we can use it to identify and apply this property only to Chinese text.</p>

              <p>Vertical text may be better suited for East Asian languages when it comes to full length body copy, but that doesn't mean other languages can't get in on the fun. We see vertically set text in print all the time.</p>
              <p>Headers or short runs of text are relatively safe to typeset vertically, and can add some typographic variety to your web layouts. We can also combine <code>writing-mode</code> with transforms or other CSS properties.</p>

              <p>Here we have 5 inline boxes. For now there is enough room so all 5 boxes fit into a single line box. But when there isn't enough room, inline boxes will be broken across line boxes. The break is known as a line break.</p>
              <p>If content wrapping is enabled, the user agent has to minimise the amount of content overflowing a line by wrapping the line at a soft wrap opportunity if one exists.</p>
              <p>For most writing systems, soft wrap opportunities occur at word boundaries, where spaces or punctuation are used to explicitly separate words.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>There is a lot of nuance because word breaking works differently depending on the language we're typesetting for.</p>
              <p>For example, English wraps at spaces. But for Japanese or Chinese characters, the break is per character, usually but not always. Because line breaks are prohibited before certain punctuation marks. </p>
              <p>A number of Southeast Asian scripts are written without spaces between words, then text is wrapped at syllable boundaries in addition to word boundaries. We could keep going here.</p>
              <p>There is interplay between the 4 properties here to provide developers more precise control over line breaking, because some rules take precedence over others if both are present, or some only take affect if <code>white-space</code> property allows wrapping, for example.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Even though we've covered quite a bit, there is still a long way to go when it comes to web typography.</p>
              <p>The CSS line box model was invented in the 90s, when technology was not as powerful as it is today. Typographers generally don't like the way CSS handles font sizes but the CSS Working Group is trying to fix things.</p>
              <p>They are thinking about rhythmic sizing and how to programmatically achieve a consistent vertical rhythm on the web, where text is often interrupted by other types and sizes of content. How to deal with situations where different font families are being used. How to support typographic features in writing systems that are not alphabetic.</p>
              <p>A lot of work is at the ideation phase because there are so many tricky problems to work out.</p>

            <h2>The leading problem</h2>
            <img data-src="img/leading.svg" style="max-height:75vh" alt="Line height" class="plain">
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>CSS allocates leading based on the line-height by subtracting the ascent and descent from the specified line-height, then splitting the remainder in half, giving each half to the top and bottom.</p>
              <p>Doing so allows us to get decently even line-spacing, but mostly if the paragraph of text is of the same font. When we have different font families on the same line, things don't line up as well because different fonts have different ideas of what 1em should be.</p>
              <p>What CSS does now is guaranteeing content never overlaps at the expense of aesthetics. But the CSSWG is trying to come up with a new algorithm to calculate the optimal line size.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Strict vertical rhythm tends to go out the window when we're trying to layout many different types of content, but it is important when it comes to things like multi-column layouts with content side-by-side.</p>
              <p>One of the proposed new properties is called <code>block-step-size</code>, which sets the height of the line to be a multiple of the value you define. But again, where should any extra space go?</p>
              <p>The CSS rhythmic sizing specification is currently sourcing for feedback.</p>

            <h2>Imagine an alternate history…</h2>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>As we close off this talk, I'd like to circle back to the idea I mentioned at the start about the origins of digital technology. Right now, we're living in a digital age. A world running on computers.</p>
              <p>These computers were pioneered in the West, in countries that use an alphabetic, left-to-right oriented writing system. This is an irreversible first-mover advantage, because less than a century later, everyone in the world, regardless of their native writing system, is more or less used to a left-to-right, top-to-bottom orientation for digital content.</p>
              <p>This isn't a criticism. It is simply an observation. Vertical writing systems like Chinese, Japanese and Korean went horizontal as Western science and technology prevailed. Even so, I cannot help but wonder, if somewhere along the timeline something changed, if the Islamic Golden Age prevailed or if the Ming Dynasty never closed China's doors? What kind of a world we would live in, and what systems would we be using?</p>
