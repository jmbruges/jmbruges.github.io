description: As part of an experimental team at the Central Laser Facility in the UK, we used an intense laser pulse to generate a high-current electron beam. This beam interacted with a solid chunk of metal to produce positrons. The resulting antimatter-matter plasma is the densest ever produced in a laboratory, and is an excellent testbed for extreme astrophysical phenomena.
