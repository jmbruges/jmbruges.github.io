description: In collaboration with a team in Jena, Germany, we show that with a laser of short enough pulse length it becomes possible to take pictures of structures moving very near the speed of light. In this case the pulse was a few femtoseconds long, and the structures in question were those of a plasma electron wake trailing a second pulse. By imaging the wake at different times, we were able to directly measure for the first time the injection dynamics of the wake.
