description: Due to the positive feedback I received from my 'Helmhurts' blog post, I decided to write an Android app which was able to simulate WiFi propagation in 2D. The app has been a moderate success so far, selling in excess of 15,000 units across mobile and ChromeOS. I plan to eventually write versions for iOS and desktop too.
