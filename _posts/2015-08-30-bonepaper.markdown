description: For the first time we showed that it was possible to use laser-wakefield driven x-ray sources to record a medically useful tomograph of a sample of human femoral bone. The x-rays so produced were high energy, of small source size and reasonably high brightness and stability. With further development we believe this achievement marks an important advance in the fields of laser-driven light sources and medical imaging.
